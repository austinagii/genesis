# Project Genesis

## Introduction

**Project Genesis** is an exploration into creating and training neural networks from scratch using Python and a few numerical libraries. This project aims to build a foundational understanding of neural networks by implementing them without relying on high-level frameworks.

### Primary Goals

- **Interactive Visualization**: Provide an interactive interface for visualizing the creation and training of neural networks.
- **Clear Implementation**: Offer a clear and understandable implementation of neural networks in Python.
- **Traceability**: Deliver insight into the building process to ensure traceability from start to finish.

### Secondary Goals

- **Ease of Setup**: Be easy to set up and run on any computer.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintain clear and well-documented code.
- **Extensibility**: Allow potential changes or forks for improvement and further understanding.
